# Keyboard Multimedia Keys on TouchBoard
Just a simple thing really, the versetality of the HID-Project library merged with the simplicity of TouchBoard.
Based on the original "HID Keyboard" example for the TouchBoard.
What you'll need:
  + A TouchBoard from Bare Conductive
  + A PC with Arduino IDE
  + the HID-Project library
  
ENJOY!
